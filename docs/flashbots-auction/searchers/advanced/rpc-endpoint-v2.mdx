### flashbots_getUserStatsV2

The `flashbots_getUserStatsV2` JSON-RPC method returns a quick summary of how a searcher is performing in the Flashbots ecosystem, including their [reputation-based priority](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/reputation). It is currently updated once every hour and has the following payload format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "flashbots_getUserStatsV2",
  "params": [
      blockNumber,       // String, a hex encoded recent block number, in order to prevent replay attacks. Must be within 20 blocks of the current chain tip.
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "isHighPriority": true,
  "allTimeValidatorPayments": "1280749594841588639",
  "allTimeGasSimulated": "30049470846",
  "last7dValidatorPayments": "1280749594841588639",
  "last7dGasSimulated": "30049470846",
  "last1dValidatorPayments": "142305510537954293",
  "last1dGasSimulated": "2731770076"
}
```

where

- `isHighPriority`: boolean representing if this searcher has a high enough reputation to be in the high priority queue
- `allTimeValidatorPayments`: the total amount paid to validators over all time
- `allTimeGasSimulated`: the total amount of gas simulated across all bundles submitted to Flashbots. This is the actual gas used in simulations, not gas limit


### flashbots_getBundleStatsV2

The `flashbots_getBundleStatsV2` JSON-RPC method returns stats for a single bundle. You must provide a blockNumber and the bundleHash, and the signing address must be the same as the one who submitted the bundle.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "flashbots_getBundleStatsV2",
  "params": [
    {
      bundleHash,       // String, returned by the flashbots api when calling eth_sendBundle
      blockNumber,       // String, the block number the bundle was targeting (hex encoded)
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json
{
  "isHighPriority": true,
  "isSimulated": true,
  "simulatedAt": "2022-10-06T21:36:06.317Z",
  "receivedAt": "2022-10-06T21:36:06.250Z",
  "consideredByBuildersAt": [
		{
			"pubkey": "0x81babeec8c9f2bb9c329fd8a3b176032fe0ab5f3b92a3f44d4575a231c7bd9c31d10b6328ef68ed1e8c02a3dbc8e80f9",
			"timestamp": "2022-10-06T21:36:06.343Z"
		},
		{
			"pubkey": "0x81beef03aafd3dd33ffd7deb337407142c80fea2690e5b3190cfc01bde5753f28982a7857c96172a75a234cb7bcb994f",
			"timestamp": "2022-10-06T21:36:06.394Z"
		},
		{
			"pubkey": "0xa1dead1e65f0a0eee7b5170223f20c8f0cbf122eac3324d61afbdb33a8885ff8cab2ef514ac2c7698ae0d6289ef27fc",
			"timestamp": "2022-10-06T21:36:06.322Z"
		}
	],
  "sealedByBuildersAt": [
      {
          "pubkey": "0x81beef03aafd3dd33ffd7deb337407142c80fea2690e5b3190cfc01bde5753f28982a7857c96172a75a234cb7bcb994f",
          "timestamp": "2022-10-06T21:36:07.742Z"
      }
  ]
}
```
where

- `isHighPriority`: boolean representing if this searcher has a high enough reputation to be in the high priority queue
- `isSimulated`: boolean representing whether the bundle gets simulated. All other fields will be omitted except simulated field if API didn't receive bundle
- `simulatedAt`: time at which the bundle gets simulated
- `receivedAt`: time at which the bundle API received the bundle
- `consideredByBuildersAt`: indicates time at which each builder selected the bundle to be included in the target block
- `sealedByBuildersAt`: indicates time at which each builder sealed a block containing the bundle

:::note

Important changes done on V2 methods which supports JSON-RPC standards for both success and error response, as V1 method supports JSON-RPC standards for success response and REST HTTP standards for error response.
