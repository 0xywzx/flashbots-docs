Flashbots Protect is the best way to transact on Ethereum. It allows regular users to easily submit their transactions to builders to protect against frontrunning, failed transactions, and to get MEV back just for transacting. 

Protect empowers the user by allowing them to choose which builders their transactions are sent to, including both the [Flashbots Builders](/docs/flashbots-builders) and the other top builders on Ethereum as well. Protect also lets users manage their own [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/overview) settings, so they can choose their privacy and where any MEV they create goes.

To recap, these are the key benefits to using Flashbots Protect:
- **Configurable:** you can choose which builders to send to and your mev-share settings.
- **Frontrunning protection:** your transaction will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.
- **Get MEV back**: if your transaction creates MEV, you get up to 90% of it back through [MEV-Share](/flashbots-mev-share/overview).
- **No failed transactions:** your transaction will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts, so you don't pay for failed transactions.

Privacy notice: **Flashbots Protect RPC does not track** any kind of user information (i.e. IP, location, etc.). No user information is ever stored or even logged.

## Using Flashbots Protect
There are three ways to use Flashbots Protect:
1. Add the Flashbots Protect RPC (`https://rpc.flashbots.net`) to your wallet. Most users will do this.
2. Send transactions to `https://rpc.flashbots.net` using [eth_sendRawTransaction](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-sendrawtransaction).
3. Send transactions to Flashbots using [eth_sendPrivateTransaction](/docs/flashbots-protect/additional-documentation/eth-sendPrivateTransaction).

Which way you integrate is up to you and your preferences. The most simple way to use Flashbots Protect is to add the Flashbots Protect RPC to your wallet. You can do so using the below button or by following the manual instructions below. **Note that you can configure the builders you send to and your MEV-Share hints as well**.
