## Using Flashbots Protect
There are three ways to use Flashbots Protect:
1. Add the Flashbots Protect RPC (`https://rpc.flashbots.net`) to your wallet. Most users will do this. You can see the [wallet quick start guide](/flashbots-protect/rpc/quick-start) to get started and use our "add to your wallet" button.
2. Send transactions to `https://rpc.flashbots.net` using [eth_sendRawTransaction](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-sendrawtransaction).
3. Send transactions to Flashbots using [eth_sendPrivateTransaction](/docs/flashbots-protect/additional-documentation/eth-sendPrivateTransaction).
