A MEV-Share Node is a service that matches user transactions with searcher bundles. Flashbots runs MEV-Share nodes on Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli. Users submit their transactions to the MEV-Share node, which shares select information about transactions with searchers. Searchers propose transactions for the MEV-Share node to bundle with the user transactions (currently we only support backruns). The MEV-Share node forwards these bundles to a block builder with a requirement that **the user is paid a kickback**; a percentage of the winning searcher's bundle profit.
