Today, orderflow providers like wallets and dapps do not participate in MEV. Their users generate MEV when transacting, but neither the user nor the orderflow provider receive any benefit from the MEV generated - it is captured by searchers and validators.

MEV-Share enables MEV redistribution whereby a portion of the MEV generated by each transaction can be redistributed to the initiating user, orderflow provider, or any other destination. In brief, implementing MEV-Share will enable orderflow providers to have sustainable business models by minimizing user impact due to MEV.

MEV-Share is an open-source protocol, not a company; Flashbots is only one participant in the system. It uses privacy and credible commitments to facilitate permissionless collaboration between users/orderflow providers and searchers. It is credibly neutral, permissionless for searchers, and does not enshrine a single block builder. Aggregating order flow to MEV-Share will greatly reduce proprietary order flow as a centralizing force on Ethereum while enabling wallets and other sources of order flow to participate in the MEV economy.
