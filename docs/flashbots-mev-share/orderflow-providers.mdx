MEV-Share Nodes generally accept transactons using the `eth_sendRawTransaction` or `eth_sendPrivateTransaction` json rpc requests. There are a wide range of different preferences and features that are offered by different nodes on top of that. Flashbots runs a MEV-Share Node that can be used by sending transactions to [Flashbots Protect](/flashbots-protect/rpc/quick-start). Wallets and application developers should see the [Protect MEV-Share Node guide](/flashbots-protect/mev-share) to configure their integration.
