To start searching on MEV-Share, you will need to connect to a matchmaker. A matchmaker receives transactions and bundles from users, and selectively shares information about transactions with searchers. When a searcher wants to include a transaction in their bundle, they use that transaction's hash, and the matchmaker replaces it with the original transaction before sending the bundle to a block builder.

## Connect to Matchmaker

Flashbots runs a matchmaker on Ethereum, to which you can connect today. The matchmaker has endpoints to receive transactions and bundles, as well as an SSE event stream endpoint which dispatches pending events/transactions to searchers.

The simplest way to connect to the Flashbots Matchmaker is to use a [client library](/flashbots-auction/searchers/libraries/matchmaker). For this guide, we'll refer to [matchmaker-ts](https://github.com/flashbots/matchmaker-ts).

If you're coding in a language that doesn't yet have a matchmaker client library, you can interact directly with the [JSON-RPC endpoint](/flashbots-auction/searchers/advanced/rpc-endpoint).

_Add library to your project:_

```sh
yarn add @flashbots/matchmaker-ts
```

_Import library code (note `ALL_CAPS` variables are placeholders; insert your own data there):_

```typescript
import { Wallet, JsonRpcProvider } from "ethers"
import Matchmaker, {
    ShareBundleParams,
    PendingShareTransaction,
    ShareTransactionOptions
} from "@flashbots/matchmaker-ts"

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
const authSigner = new Wallet(FB_REPUTATION_PRIVATE_KEY, provider)
const matchmaker = new Matchmaker(authSigner, {chainId: 1, name: "mainnet"})
```

:::note A note for experienced searchers getting acquainted with MEV-Share

Searching on MEV-Share is different from searching on the mempool in that only certain parts of a transaction are shared with searchers. On the mempool, we can see all parts of a transaction, such as calldata and logs. But on MEV-Share, a transaction might only reveal its function selector or the liquidity pool it's trading on.

New searching strategies will have to be implemented to include these partially-hidden transactions in your bundles. Specifically, searchers may have to reason about the context of markets and/or blockchain state separately from the transaction, and make a proabilistic transaction or set of transactions, leveraging whatever data is provided by the user's transaction.

This does not mean that existing strategies can't be used. Transactions on MEV-Share still have the option to share any parts of the transaction, so strategies that use calldata and/or logs are still viable.
