title: Event Stream
---

Events on MEV-Share are distributed via an SSE endpoint. Searchers listen to this endpoint to receive a stream of new events, which contain data they can use in their bundles. Currently, the events refer to Ethereum transactions.

## Quickstart

Subscribe to the stream by making an HTTP GET request on the stream endpoint.

```sh
curl https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net
```

### Event Stream Endpoints

| Network | URL |
|-|-|
| Mainnet | https://mev-share.flashbots.net |
| Goerli | https://mev-share-goerli.flashbots.net |

The endpoint sends an event with the message `:ping` every 15 seconds if no other messages were sent in the last 15 seconds.

_response:_

```sh
:ping

data: {"txHash":"0x4dcc7236a9827ff5d2c024f337e373cee6811909e066b0468b26cc56d5d6279f","to":"0x0000c335bc9d5d1af0402cad63fa7f258363d71a","functionSelector":"0x696d2073","logs":null,"callData":"0x696d20736861726969696969696e67"}

# blocks until terminated manually (CTRL-C)
```


## Event Scheme

```typescript
{
    txHash: string,
    to?: string,
    functionSelector?: string,
    logs?: LogParams[],
    callData?: string,
}
```

| Param | Type Info | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `txHash` | Hex-string | Transaction hash. |
| `to` | Hex-string | Transaction recipient address. |
| `functionSelector` | Hex-string | 4-byte function selector. |
| `logs` | Array of JSON-encoded events | Event logs emitted by executing the transaction. |
| `callData` | Hex-string | calldata of the tx. |
